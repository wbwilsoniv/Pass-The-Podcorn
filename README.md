# Pass-The-Podcorn
Pass the Podcorn is a podcast review app where users can see various podcasts and leave a review on a podcast if they've heard it before! They will have full CRUD capabilities with whatever podcasts they’ve created and can also add new podcasts and reviews. 



## Motivation

We wanted a resource to share podcasts. We thought this would be a cool project to work on for our group project considering that all of us really love listening to them. 

## General Approach

For this project, we decided that starting out with a basic ERD would be the easiest way to approach it. After drawing out an ERD and stating the relationships between the two tables, we broke our app into two components: An app directory with files to control the back-end and a client directory with files to control the front end. For our backend, we set up a seed file and schema file, where we hard-coded data into to build our database for testing. 

From there we set about building up the app where we would define our models, controllers and routes for CRUD on both podcasts and reviews.

For the client side, which will be our front-end we used create-react-app to create our Pass The Podcorn app. 

After creating both a functional front-end and back-end, we used CSS and Bulma to style and format our app.

    })

        console.log(err);
        res.status(400).json({message: '400', err});
    });
};
